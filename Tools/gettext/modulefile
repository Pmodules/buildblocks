This is the GNU gettext package.  It is interesting for authors or
maintainers of other packages or programs which they want to see
internationalized.  As one step the handling of messages in different
languages should be implemented.  For this task GNU gettext provides
the needed tools and library functions.

It is also interesting for translators, because GNU gettext provides
the 'msgmerge' program, which prepares a message catalog before a
translation update.
