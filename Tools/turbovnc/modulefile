TurboVNC is a high-speed version of VNC derived from TightVNC. It contains a
variant of Tight encoding that is tuned to maximize performance for
image-intensive applications (such as VirtualGL, video applications, and image
editors) while still providing excellent performance for other types of
applications. TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete
solution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance.
