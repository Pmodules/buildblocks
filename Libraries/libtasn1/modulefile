Libtasn1 is the ASN.1 library used by GnuTLS, p11-kit and some other
packages. It was originally written by Fabio Fiorina, and now maintained
as a GNU package.

The goal of this implementation is to be highly portable, and only require
an ANSI C99 platform.

For status information on what's happening with the package, see the NEWS
file from live sources.
