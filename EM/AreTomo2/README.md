# AreTomo2

AreTomo2, a multi-GPU accelerated software package that fully automates motion-corrected marker-free tomographic alignment and reconstruction, now includes robust GPU-accelerated CTF (Contrast Transfer Function) estimation in a single package. AreTomo2 is part of our endeavor to build a fully-automated high-throughput processing pipeline that enables real-time reconstruction of tomograms in parallel with tomographic data collection. It strives to be fast and accurate, as well as provides for easy integration into subtomogram processing workflows by generating IMod compatible files containing alignment and CTF parameters needed to bootstrap subtomogram averaging. AreTomo2 can also be used for on-the-fly reconstruction of tomograms and CTF estimation in parallel with tilt series collection, enabling real-time assessment of sample quality and adjustment of collection parameters.
