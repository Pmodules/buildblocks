Entrez Direct (EDirect) provides access to Entrez, the NCBI's suite of
interconnected databases (publication, sequence, structure, gene, variation,
expression, etc.) from a Unix terminal window. Search terms are entered as
command-line arguments. Individual operations are connected with Unix pipes to
construct multi-step queries. Selected records can then be retrieved in a
variety of formats.
