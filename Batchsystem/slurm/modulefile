Slurm is an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster
management and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters.

Slurm requires no kernel modifications for its operation and is relatively
self-contained. As a cluster workload manager, Slurm has three key functions:

  * First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources
    (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform
    work.
  * Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring
    work  (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes.
  * Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of
    pending work.

Optional plugins can be used for accounting, advanced reservation, gang
scheduling (time sharing for parallel jobs), backfill scheduling, topology
optimized resource selection, resource limits by user or bank account, and
sophisticated multifactor job prioritization algorithms.
