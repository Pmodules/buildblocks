PnetCDF is a high-performance parallel I/O library for accessing files in
format compatibility with Unidata's NetCDF, specifically the formats of
CDF-1, 2, and 5. The CDF-5 file format, an extension of CDF-2, supports
unsigned data types and uses 64-bit integers to allow users to define
large dimensions, attributes, and variables (> 2B array elements).

In addition to the conventional netCDF read and write APIs, PnetCDF also
provides a new set of nonblocking APIs. Nonblocking APIs allow users to
post multiple read and write requests first, and later let PnetCDF to
aggregate the requests into a large MPI-IO request, hence to achieve a
better performance. See nonblocking I/O for further description and example
programs.
