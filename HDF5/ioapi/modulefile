The Models-3 Input/Output Applications Programming Interface (I/O API) is
a selective and direct-access programming interface to the data: you tell
the system what variables and dates and times you're talking about and it
figures all the stuff about record numbers, etc., for itself. Also, you
don't have to read the data in consecutive order, or to write it in order,
either -- you just ask for what you want, and the I/O API finds it for you
(although there are moderate performance penalties for writing data out-of-
order). The files are self-describing files -- that is, the file headers
have all the dimensioning and descriptive information needed about the data
in them.
